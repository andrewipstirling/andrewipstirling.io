        In these projects, I was able to work with a multitude of robots in my Applied Robotics Graduate Course.
        The main highlights consisted of implementing kinematic and dynamic controllers
        for the Kinova Kortex arm, that were able to achieve commanded positions in a set amount of time.

        Building off the controllers, I used ROS action servers to perform various tasks such as cleaning
        a table of boxes, or pick-and-place.
