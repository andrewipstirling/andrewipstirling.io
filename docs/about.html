<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
    Hi! My name is Andrew Stirling. I am a Master's (Thesis) student at McGill University studying Robotics, 
    with the <a href="https://www.decar.ca/">DECAR</a> Lab.
    
    I am currently researching problems in navigation/estimation for multi-agent robotic systems in 
    GNSS (GPS) denied environments through the use of UWB.
