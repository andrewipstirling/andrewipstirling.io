        In this project with the CoRoLab at the Berlin University of Applied Science and Technology, I helped investigate 
        a control strategy that combined Proportional-Derivative (PD) control with Iterative Learning Control (ILC) to 
        enhance legged robot velocity control. The first step was deriving a first principles, kinematic model of the Unitree Go1. 
        Using the inverse kinematics equations derived from this allowed us to control individual foot positions in reference to the 
        shoulder (hip) joints, forming the basis of the control strategy.

        Using PD Control, each foot is able to follow these step trajectories, resulting in a trotting gait. However, PD turned out 
        to not be satisfactory for performance, with the Go1 being unable to accurately follow desired trotting speeds. 
        To improve upon this, we integrated ILC, which traditionally was only used for fixed robots such as robotic arms. 
        The architecture for the PD-ILC method can be found below

    <p>Finally, with both the PD-ILC, we were able to obtain good performance with velocity errors diminishing to under 5% after the ILC has kicked in.</p>
