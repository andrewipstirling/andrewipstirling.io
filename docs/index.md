# About Me


Hi, my name is Andrew Stirling! I'm an undergraduate student in Mechanical Engineering minoring in Computer Science, at McGill University. Given my background, I love integrating traditional engineering topics such as control, design, and optimization, with my CS knowledge to produce interesting projects within the field of Robotics ranging from new control methods, computer vision for pose estimation and machine learning.
