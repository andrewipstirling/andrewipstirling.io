# About Me


Hi! My name is Andrew Stirling. I am a Master's (Thesis) student at McGill University studying Robotics, 
with the <a href="https://www.decar.ca/">DECAR</a> Lab.
    
I am currently researching problems in navigation/estimation for multi-agent robotic systems in 
GNSS (GPS) denied environments through the use of UWB technology.

Please see below for a list of recent projects in chronological order. 

- [Unitree Go1 Controller](go1.html)
- [Soft Actor-Critic for Inverted Pendulum Control](sac.html)
- [Multi-Camera, Image-Guided Neurosurgery](capstone.html)
- [Applied Robotics](ar.html)
- [CV](cv.html)
