# About Me


Hi, my name is Andrew Stirling! I'm an undergraduate student in Mechanical Engineering minoring in Computer Science, at McGill University. Given my background, I love integrating traditional engineering topics such as control, design, and optimization, with my CS knowledge to produce interesting projects ranging from robotics, control, computer vision and machine learning.
