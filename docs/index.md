# About Me

Hi! My name is Andrew Stirling. I am a Master's (Thesis) student at McGill University studying Robotics, 
with the <a href="https://www.decar.ca/">DECAR</a> Lab.
    
I am currently researching problems in navigation/estimation for multi-agent robotic systems in 
GNSS (GPS) denied environments through the use of UWB technology.

Below is a list of selected projects, which will be updated as ongoing 
projects progress and new ones begin. Click to learn more, and connect with
me using the links on the left if you have any questions!
