    <p>
        In my final year Capstone project, my team partnered with the Neuro-Imaging and Surgical Technologies 
        Lab (NIST) at McGill, to develop a multi-camera object tracking system to overcome problems that traditional
        single infrared (IR) camera approaches suffer from, such as occlusion.

        The project is still in the developmental stage however all design stages have been completed,
        and we are rapidly converging on a physical protoype.
