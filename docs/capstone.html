        In my final year Capstone project, my team partnered with the Neuro-Imaging and Surgical Technologies 
        Lab (NIST) at McGill, to develop a multi-camera object tracking system to overcome problems that traditional
        single infrared (IR) camera approaches suffer from, such as occlusion.

    <p>
        While still in development, we look to design and construct a module holding multiple cameras, which
        can be placed on top of operating room surgical lights. Using fiducial markers attached to the patient 
        and surgical tool, we hope to obtain precise tracking information on the tool itself, through fusion of the 
        different cameras. Tracking data will be able to overlayed on CT scans performed by the hospital in order 
        to provide exact, and real-time feedback to the surgeon.

      Currently we are in the prototyping phase but preliminary models can be seen below.
